# Chatbot

We used the telegram bot as proposed in the assignment, called "Freek".
We use the Cornell Movie Database (Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus) as training for our chatterbot chatbot.



Changes made to data:
UTF-8 didn't recognise things like ('),(Ã¨),(,), etc. so we changed these manually in the movie_lines.txt.
