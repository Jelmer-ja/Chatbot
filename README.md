# Chatbot

We used the telegram bot as proposed in the assignment, called "Freek".
We use the Cornell Movie Database (Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus) as training for our chatterbot chatbot (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ChatterBot/0.4.3).



Changes made to data:
UTF-8 didn't recognise things like ('),(Ã¨),(,), etc. so we changed these manually in the movie_lines.txt.
