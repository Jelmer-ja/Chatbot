# Chatbot

We started out with the standard telegram bot as proposed in the assignment. Our chatbot is called called "Freek", and his Telegram username is "@fr33k_bot".

# Functionalities

## Normal Dialogue
Freek is a rather dramatic chatbot. His standard dialogue interactions are taken from the Cornell Movie Database (Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus). We train our chatbot on this database using the Python package [Chatterbot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ChatterBot/0.4.3), which uses  to train the bot to find the most appropriate responses to the input. 

## Question Answering


## Movie Quotation

# Notes
UTF-8 didn't recognise things like ('),(Ã¨),(,), etc. so we changed these manually in the movie_lines.txt.
