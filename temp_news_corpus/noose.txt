Giovanni della Robbia, the Antinori lunette and Stefano Arienti\u201d features della Robbia\u2019s lunette on loan from the Brooklyn Museum, where it has been housed since it was purchased and promptly donated by Brooklyn magnate Aaron Augustus Healy in 1898.\n\nFrom November 8, 2017 to April 8, 2018, the show at the Bargello provides an innovative dialogue between the Renaissance and the present day by placing the lunette side by side with Scena Fissa, a piece by internationally renowned contemporary artist Stefano Arienti, directly inspired by Della Robbia\u2019s work.\n\nThe exhibition is staged in collaboration with the Antinori Art Project, an initiative of the centuries-old Antinori family who hosts works of contemporary art in their wine cellars in the Chianti Classico region. The Antinori family have long supported the arts; indeed, it was their distant ancestor Niccol\xf2 di Tommaso Antinori who commissioned Giovanni della Robbia to create the lunette, likely around 1520, and who can be seen kneeling beside Christ and the soldiers. Nearly 500 years later, the same family backed the restoration of the piece in anticipation of its display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 2016.\n\nConcurrently with the Bargello exhibition, the Antinori wine cellars will host a second work by Arienti, a site-specific installation titled "Altorilievo", which, like the other pieces commissioned for the Antinori Art Project, will become a part of the family\u2019s permanent collection, highlighting the strong connection between history and patronage.',)(u'Mary Ann Adams Maverick (Mrs. Samuel Maverick) in 1896 was a charter member of the Barnard Bee chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy that erected the Confederate monument in Travis Park on land her family (had) owned. I have been unable to locate her membership papers but know by her memoirs that she sent four boys and her husband to serve the Confederacy. I saw in an old news article that she and other ladies had made a Confederate flag to send with the men going off to war, and this flag was found and returned years later. Do you know what her involvement or wishes were with the monument planning from 1896 until her death in 1898 shortly before the cornerstone dedication?\n\nAs you\u2019ll know from the \u201cMemoirs of Mary A. Maverick\u201d (1921, Alamo Printing Co.), the Maverick family members in Texas were slow to warm to the cause of the Confederacy but went all in when patriarch Samuel Maverick \u2014 previously an antisecessionist \u2014 \u201ccame to believe the quarrel was forced upon us.\u201d In the words of his wife, originally from Alabama, the South Carolina-born landowner felt \u201ccompelled to take his choice for or against his kith and kin.\u201d The question of which side to take in the Civil War \u201ccame down to this: Even if you could separate yourself from your people, would your heart permit you to do it?\u201d\n\nA state legislator, Maverick attended the Texas Secession Convention early in 1861 in Austin, where he was appointed one of the state\u2019s three secession commissioners, says his entry in the Handbook of Texas. As such, he and the others \u201csuccessfully effected the removal of federal troops and the transfer stores in Texas to the state government.\u201d\n\nOf the couple\u2019s 10 children, four were sons old enough to serve. \u201cTheir youthful and warm sympathies were aroused, and a simple sense of duty carried them hand and heart with their state.\u201d Samuel, born in 1837 and already out of college, enlisted in the 1st Texas Cavalry and transferred to the 8th Texas Cavalry, \u201cthe gallant Terry Rangers,\u201d to get closer to the fighting. Lewis, born in 1839, left the University of North Carolina to sign up with the 1st North Alabama Regiment, later returning to his home state to raise a company for the 32nd Texas Cavalry. George at 16 was sworn in as a member of that company, and William turned 17 in 1865, just in time to wear the gray for the last months of the war.\n\nTheir mother was an active member of many clubs, including the Battle of Flowers Association, Daughters of the Republic of Texas, San Antonio Historical Alamo Monument Association, Women of St. Mark\u2019s Episcopal Church and the Alamo Monument Association, of which she was president. This group was in favor of building a monument to the defenders of the Alamo that would have been installed about where the Cenotaph is now. Designed by architect Alfred Giles, renowned for his Texas courthouses, it was planned to consist of a stone pedestal, shaft and heroic figure on top \u2014 \u201csomething like the Confederate monument in Travis Park,\u201d says a historical article in the San Antonio Express, Oct. 17, 1965. Giles\u2019 proposal was accepted in March 1887 by the association. The Alamo monument, in his plans, was to reach a soaring 163 feet, and the figure was to be holding a rifle and \u201cwaving a coonskin cap,\u201d suggesting David Crockett, although the column was to be inscribed \u201cWilliam Barret Travis.\u201d By comparison, the Confederate memorial completed in 1900 rose 40 feet, with the figure of an anonymous soldier holding a rifle atop a base dedicated to the Confederate dead.\n\nFundraising for the Alamo monument seems to have fallen short: \u201cA campaign, in which members of the Maverick family were prominent, raised $25,000 for Giles\u2019 monument,\u201d says the Express, \u201cbut then the idea lay dormant for years.\u201d It\u2019s possible that this experience might have informed the local Daughters of the Confederacy as they planned their more modestly conceived monument, which cost only $3,000, according to the San Antonio Light, April 30, 1900.\n\nWhether Mary Ann Maverick was involved in the planning is debatable. The Barnard E. Bee chapter of what would become the United Daughters of the Confederacy was organized Oct. 6, 1896. Maverick died Feb. 24, 1898, less than a month before what would have been her 80th birthday, March 18, 1898. Incredible as it might seem to us, an obituary published on the day of her death, the Light referred to her as \u201cSan Antonio\u2019s oldest citizen\u201d and the city\u2019s \u201coldest living inhabitant.\u201d A wealthy widow as beneficiary of her husband\u2019s will, she had not been living independently but \u201chad been residing with her son William\u201d and died at the home of her son George.\n\nMaverick states in her memoirs that for her family, at the end of the Civil War, \u201cAll the old issues had been settled, and the result of the conflict was right.\u201d One of many issues that continued to be contested between North and South for decades was the question of what to do with Confederate flags that had been captured by federal troops. While many had made it home and were displayed by the Confederate Veterans and other groups, eventually finding their way to museums, others adorned the walls of the meeting places of Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) posts as trophies or were held by the War Department in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe first proposal to return the latter flags was shot down in 1887 by President Grover Cleveland after vigorous protests from the GAR and northern politicians. So, too soon\u2026but by the time the idea was proposed again in 1905, the nation had been united in fighting the Spanish-American War, and Congress passed a law backed by President Theodore Roosevelt that required the flags to be returned to the states of their origin.\n\nOne that made it home earlier was the battle flag of Terry\u2019s Texas Rangers \u2014 Samuel Maverick\u2019s second unit \u2014 brought to the Texas State Fair in Dallas on \u201cex-Confederate Day,\u201d Oct. 4, 1899, a \u201clove feast\u201d for Confederate veterans mostly orchestrated by the Confederate Daughters. As reported by the Light of that date, the banner was returned by Indiana Gov. James A. Mount to \u201csurvivors of the troop from which it was taken by the 17th Indiana Regiment \u2026 in accordance with a resolution adopted by the last session of the Indiana General Assembly.\u201d In return, Texas dignitaries gave the visiting governor a \u201chandsome silk banner\u201d that incorporated the Stars and Stripes, pictures of the governors and coats of arms of both states and a \u201csuitable inscription.\u201d\n\nAbout 40 former Terry\u2019s Rangers were present out of about 5,000 former Confederate soldiers; James Miller, president of the Texas Terry Rangers Association accepted the flag, says the Light, Oct. 5, 1899. The ceremony was part of Texas-Indiana Day, apparently an occasion to promote tourist visits from the latter state. The articles don\u2019t say anything about the origins of the flag nor where it would be kept.\n\nAnyone with further information about a flag connected with Mary Ann Maverick may contact this column.
